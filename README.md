My first game, a roguelike/dungeoncrawler working on in the LOVE2D engine in Lua.
Disregard framerate on gif, framerate in-game is normal.

Currently the rooms / terrain are generated randomly but there are only the 2 enemy types you see in the gif.
The end goal is to make a roguelike with floors and a boss on each floor, with level progression granting access to more spell combinations and items granting unique modifiers.

I'm not much of an artist so it's slow going!
